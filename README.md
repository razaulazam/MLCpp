# Pattern Analysis Algorithms

mean_shift_algorithm: Contains the implementation of the mean shift clustering algorithm which is used when we do not have an idea about the number of clusters, our data can be grouped into.

dimensionality_reduction_algorithms: Contains the implementation of the famous PCA and IsoMap algorithms that are commonly used for feature selection purposes in Machine learning.

random_forest: Contains the implementation of the famous Machine learning algorithm called Random Forest. This algorithm is inspired by the basic Decision trees.

hidden_markov_model: Contains the implementation of the forward and viterbi algorithm which are used with a Hidden Markov Model for decoding hidden state sequences.
